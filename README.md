🚀 Westbound Weapon Enhancer (FE Combat Module)
Hello there! This script is a clean, reliable module for optimizing your combat experience in Westbound. Tired of low fire rates and needing ten shots for a kill? This fixes it.

✨ Key Features
Instant TTK (Time-to-Kill): Engineered for maximum damage output, ensuring your hits count immediately. You hit, they drop.

Zero Downtime: Reloads and weapon swapping are virtually instantaneous. Keep the pressure up without pause.

Laser Accuracy: Tightened shot grouping means your bullets go exactly where you aim, whether you're hip-firing or scoped.

Maximized Responsiveness: Eliminates equip delays and fire animations. Your gun is ready and firing the moment you click.

Infinite Capacity: Never run out of ammo again. Focus on the fight, not the resupply.

📝 Note on Use
This module is designed for continuous execution via an external tool (Executor). Use the provided loop structure to maintain modifications and bypass server resets. We rely on your existing aim solution (autoclicker/aimbot) for maximum effectiveness—this script provides the power and speed.
